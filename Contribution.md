## Guidelines

* Verify that the link you want to add states that the Ethereum project is failing / ending / over / killed / outclassed / dead / going to zero either in the post title or in its contents.
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Add a single link per Pull Request.
* Remember to update the death counter at the top.
* Add the link and respect the formatting: `- Date - [Post-title](http://example.com/) - Author - *Publication* - **$Price**.`
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.
